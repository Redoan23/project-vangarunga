            </p>
            <p>I was about to faint climbing this hill. I was literally searching for water but unfortunately we were totally run out water, and a mistake we did not thinking about dehidration for at least once. anyway we reached there and enjoyed a beautiful sunset. The hardship was totally worthy, Alhamdulillah. 
            </p>

                here look my another picture from the top of the hill, taken that day: <br><br>
